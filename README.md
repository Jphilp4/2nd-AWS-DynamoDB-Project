# AWS-DynamoDB-Project-With-CLI
# 🤖 Getting Insights from a DynamoDB Table

---

## Project Overview  
In this project, I explored how to extract insights from a DynamoDB table. While relational databases benefit from tools like SQL, DynamoDB queries have their own unique structure. 

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🌟 **Created a new DynamoDB table**: Set up a DynamoDB table and uploaded sample data using AWS CloudShell.  
- 🔎 **Used Partition and Sort keys**: Leveraged these keys to efficiently find and manage data.  
- ✍️ **Queried a DynamoDB table**: Performed queries through the AWS console and CLI for hands-on experience.
